# Effects Pedalboard 

For my A-level Computer Science NEA Project, I decided to create a web-based digital effects pedalboard with reverb and delay effects. The purpose of this project was to help provide a solution to musicians having to deal with moving heavy and clunky pedalboards around, alongside all of the cabling that comes with it. 
My project aims to solve that by creating a web-based pedalboard where users can enable real-time manipulation of their chosen audio source with reverb and delay effects.

In my project you can enable your microphone access to apply the different effects to your mic audio. The other option for an audio source is for you to input an audio file of you choice (.mp3, .wav, .ogg files allowed) and then try out the effects on the audio playing. 

My plan moving forward is to create more effects pedals (distortion, looper etc) to use and to introduce some interesting functionality such as enabling the user to save and retrieve their chosen pedal configurations using presets. The ideas I have for this project didn't end when I completed my NEA and handed it in for marking but have only expanded for the future. 

I hope you enjoy the project! Any questions please reach out to me at willb061006@gmail.com
